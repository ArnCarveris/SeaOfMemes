The SeaOfMemes repo contains several projects:

Demos     -- various algorithm demonstrations and test programs.
Games     -- parts of the main project or spinoffs.
Milligram -- my multiplatform framework.

To build:

At the top, find BuildLinux, BuildOSX or BuildWin.  The make files here
will build the entire project, starting with the Milligram framework, 
then the demos, then the games.

Inside Demos, Games and Milligram, you will also find Build* directories
which rebuild all projects in the directory.  And in each leaf project such 
as Games/SeaOfMemes, you will also find Build* directories to build that
project.

BuildLinux* requires the standard gnu programming tools.  Execution of 
  the programs under Linux requires several packages.  See the ReadMe.

BuildOSX* requires XCode 4.1 or better, with command line tools installed.

BuildWin* requires Visual Studio 2010 Express or better, with the Windows 7 SDK
and DirectX SDK.
