To run the Linux version of the demos under Ubuntu, make sure you
have the following packages installed:

  libopenal1                  -- audio support
  ttf-mscorefonts-installer   -- font library
  
For 64-bit systems running the 32-bit demos:

  ia32-libs

If click on the demo executable does nothing, check the file
"errors.txt".  If no text file was created, you probably need
the ia32-libs package.
